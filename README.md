# Cloud Pirates Podcast

Recorded each Tuesday, starting from 12/12/2023 using Zoom, published once every two weeks (date to be determined).
If we have to record or go Live with a guest, day of recording may vary.
There won't be a lot of cutting going on, the experience will basically be like a live podcast all the time, even with recorded videos.
